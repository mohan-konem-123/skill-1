        Machu Picchu is an Incan citadel set high in the Andes Mountains in Peru, above the Urubamba River valley. 
        Built in the 15th century and later abandoned, itâ€™s renowned for its sophisticated dry-stone walls that fuse 
        huge blocks without the use of mortar, intriguing buildings that play on astronomical alignments and panoramic 
        views. Its exact former use remains a mystery.
